# React Native Background Color and Text Styling

This project demonstrates how to change the background color of a `View` component, update the text to display "My name is YourName", increase the font size of the text, and make the name bold in a React Native application.

## Steps to Accomplish the Task

### 1. Change the Background Color of the `View` Component

To change the background color of the `View` component, I added a `backgroundColor` property to the `container` style in the `StyleSheet`.

### 2. Edit the `Text` Component to Display "My name is YourName"

To edit the `Text` component, I used a nested `Text` component within the main `Text` component. This allows me to apply different styles to different parts of the text. The main `Text` component displays "My name is", and the nested `Text` component displays "YourName".

### 3. Increase the Font Size of the Text to 24

To increase the font size of the text, I added a `fontSize` property with a value of `24` to the `text` style in the `StyleSheet`.

### 4. Make the Name "YourName" Bold

To make the name "YourName" bold, I applied a `fontWeight` property with a value of `bold` to the `boldText` style in the `StyleSheet`. This style is then applied to the nested `Text` component.
